In this section, you can configure the Geolocation API to get the country code 
corresponding to the IP address. There are two types of APIs: a type that uses 
Geolocation databases downloaded to the own server and a type that hits an 
external REST API.

Please check the license and Terms & Use of each API.

to your server.

In addition, the followings provide the REST API for free. For each service,
there are some restrictions on the number of calls per day and some require 
registration for API keys. Please check the terms of service of each service.

<div class="alert alert-info">
When "<strong>Do not send IP address to external APIs</strong>" in "<strong>
Privacy and record settings</strong>" is enabled, those types are not 
selectable. But you can use "<strong>Search IP address geolocation</strong>".
In this case, an IP address is automatically anonymized before sending to the 
REST API.
