Since the last update of this plugin, 2 plugins were notified of having serious
[privilege escalation][PrivilegeEsc] vulnerability. One was [WP GDPR Compliance
Plugin][Vuln-WP-GDPR] and another was [AMP for WP &#8211; Accelerated Mobile 
Pages][Vuln-AMP-WP]. 

I belive that the sites which have [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] activated might
be protected against the attacks to those vulnerabilities in some cases, but it
was not perfect.

In this release, [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] has been enhanced to protect 
against this type of attack, based on the principle of security by design.

### New feature: Network wide settings ###

In the past, I analyzed and reported [the typical cause of privilege escalation
vulnerability in WordPress][SoVulnerable].

### New feature: Network wide settings ###

When [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] is network activated on multi-site, you can 
find "**Network**" link on each settings page or "**Sites list**" on network 
admin dashboard.

)

### Improvement: Better compatibility with cache plugins ###
