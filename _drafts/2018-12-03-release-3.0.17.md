Since the last update of this plugin, 2 plugins were notified of having serious
[privilege escalation][PrivilegeEsc] vulnerability. One was [WP GDPR Compliance
Plugin][Vuln-WP-GDPR] and another was [AMP for WP &#8211; Accelerated Mobile 
Pages][Vuln-AMP-WP]. 

In this release, [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] has been enhanced to protect 
against this type of attack, based on the principle of security by design.

### New feature: Metadata Exploit Protection ###

In the past, I analyzed and reported [the typical case of privilege escalation 
vulnerability][SoVulnerable] in WordPress. Both [WP GDPR Compliance Plugin]
[WP-GDPR] and [AMP for WP][AMP-WP] had felled into this trap.

The following picture shows the action name that will be the entry point for 
attacks on these plugins.

![Privilege Escalation]({{ '/img/2018-12/PrivilegeEscalation.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Privilege Escalation"
)

I believe that the sites which have the previous version of [IP Geo Block]
[IP-Geo-Block] activated might be protected against those type of attacks in 
some cases, but it was not perfect.

From this release, a smart and powerful method named as WP-MEP (WP Metadata 
Exploit Protection) is added. You don't need to enable expressly to activate 
this feature.

### New feature: Network wide settings ###

When [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] is network activated on multi-site, you can 
find "**Network wide settings**" in "**Plugin settings**" section. 

![Network wide settings]({{ '/img/2018-12/NetworkWide.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Network wide settings"
)

After you enable it, you'll find "**Settings**" tab next to "**Sites list**" 
on network admin dashboard.

![Network Admin Dashboard]({{ '/img/2018-12/NetworkAdmin.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Network Admin Dashboard"
)

### New feature: Preset filters ###

In version 3.0.15, two new filter hooks [`ip-geo-block-logs`,
`ip-geo-block-logs-preset`][LogPreset] which can filter the specific log 
entries for ease of analysis were added. This feature was based on the awesome 
proposal in [the forum topic][Tony-G-Topic] by [Tony G][Tony-G].

I found it was very useful in order to identify which requests should be passed
or blocked. So I introduced this feature as a regular functionality as follows:

![Preset filters]({{ '/img/2018-12/PresetFilters.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Preset filters"
)

### TL;DR: The description of this plugin ###

I updated the description of this plugin [on WP.org][IP-Geo-Block] as follows:

> The more you install themes and plugins, the more likely your sites will be 
> vulnerable, even if you [securely harden your sites][HardenSite].
>
> While WordPress.org [provides][WPSecurity] [excellent][Excellent] 
> [resources][Resources] themes and plugins may often get vulnerable due to 
> developers' [human factors][HumanFactors] such as lack of security awareness,
> misuse and disuse of the best practices in those resources.
>
> This plugin focuses on insights into such developers' human factors instead 
> of detecting the specific attack vectors after they were disclosed. This 
> brings a smart and powerful methods named as "**WP Zero-day Exploit 
> Prevention**" and "**WP Metadata Exploit Protection**".
>
> Combined with those methods and IP address geolocation, you'll be supprised
> to find a bunch of malicious or undesirable access blocked in the logs of
> this plugin after several days of installation.

I'm very proud of this plugin which has the only approach among security 
plugins ever released so far.

Have fun! <span class="emoji">
