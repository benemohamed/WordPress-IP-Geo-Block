This release mainly includes one new feature for multi-site and 
two improvements related to the compatibility.

<!--more-->

### New feature: Sites list on network ###

When [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] is network activated on multi-site, you can 
find "**Network**" link on each settings page or "**Sites list**" on network 
admin dashboard.

![Sites list on network]({{ '/img/2018-11/SitesList.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Sites list on network"
)

On this page you can see at a glance what requests each site blocked.

### Improvement: Better compatibility with cache plugins ###

From this release, [Swift Performance Lite][SwiftLite] can be compatible with 
[IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block].

[![Swift Performance Lite](https://ps.w.org/swift-performance-lite/assets/banner-772x250.jpg
 "Swift Performance Lite &#124; WordPress.org"
)][SwiftLite]

And also fixed the issue that the error page was cached by [WP Fastest Cache]
[FastestCache] when a request came from blacklisted countries or IPs.

See more details on [Compatibility with cache plugins][CompatCache].


### Improvement: Expansion of simulation mode ###

In the previous version, "[**Simulation mode**][SimMode]" that enables to 
simulate validation without deployment of blocking behavior could be applied 
only for front-end.

From this release, it works on both back-end and front-end so that you can 
check if some compatibility issues are there or not in [Validation logs][Logs].

Have fun! <span class="emoji">
