Since the last update of IP Geo Block, two plugins were notified of having 
serious [privilege escalation][PrivilegeEsc] vulnerability. One was [WP GDPR 
Compliance Plugin][Vuln-WP-GDPR] and another was [AMP for WP &#8211; 
Accelerated Mobile Pages][Vuln-AMP-WP].

In this release, [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] has been enhanced to prevent 
security attacks against this type of vulnerability, based on the principle of 
"Security by Design".

### New feature: Metadata Exploit Protection ###

In the past, I analyzed and reported [the typical case of privilege escalation 
vulnerability][SoVulnerable] in WordPress. Both WP [GDPR Compliance Plugin]
[WP-GDPR] and [AMP for WP][AMP-WP] had fell into this trap therefore attackers 
could modify WordPress database.

The following picture shows the name of action that could be the attack surface
 on these plugins.

![Privilege Escalation]({{ '/img/2018-12/PrivilegeEscalation.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Privilege Escalation"
)

I confirmed that the sites which have the previous version of [IP Geo Block]
[IP-Geo-Block] activated might be protected against those attacks under certain
conditions. The former can be blocked by country and the later can be blocked 
by both country and **WP Zero-day Exploit Prevention** (WP-ZEP).

From this release, a smart and powerful method named as **WP Metadata Exploit 
Protection** (WP-MEP) is added.

#### How WP-MEP works ####

Software has to follow the "Security by Design" principle in these days. In a 
narrow sense, it means considering security as early as the design phase of 
the software development process. For example, software handles data without 
exception so that developers have to consider the followings:

- Who access the data with which privilege
- What risk or threat exists if someone access the data without privilege

The most important thing here is that taking these into consideration never 
depends on attack vectors such as XSS which was the typical flaw of 
[AMP for WP][Wordfence].

WordPress core provides some functions to manage [Roles and Capabilities]
[Role-Cap] to put the above considerations into practice, but the usage of 
these completely depends on insecure developers. **WP-MEP** will manage and 
protect metadata on behalf of such developers.

![phpMyAdmin]({{ '/img/2018-12/phpMyAdmin.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "phpMyAdmin"
)

Currently, **WP-MEP** covers <code>{$wpdb->prefix}_options</code> and 
<code>{$wpdb->prefix}_sitemeta</code>. And you don't need to enable 
expressly to activate this feature.

### New feature: Network wide settings ###

When [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] is network activated on multi-site, you can 
find "**Network wide settings**" option in "**Plugin settings**" section. 

![Network wide settings]({{ '/img/2018-12/NetworkWide.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Network wide settings"
)

After you enable it, you'll find "**Settings**" tab next to "**Sites list**" 
on network admin dashboard.

![Network Admin Dashboard]({{ '/img/2018-12/NetworkAdmin.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Network Admin Dashboard"
)

### New feature: Preset filters ###

In version 3.0.15, two new filter hooks [`ip-geo-block-logs`,
`ip-geo-block-logs-preset`][LogPreset] which can filter the specific log 
entries for ease of analysis were added. This feature was based on the awesome 
proposal in [the forum topic][Tony-G-Topic] by [Tony G][Tony-G].

I found it was very useful in order to identify which requests should be passed
or blocked. So I introduced this feature as a regular functionality as follows:

![Preset filters]({{ '/img/2018-12/PresetFilters.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Preset filters"
)

### TL;DR: The description of this plugin ###

I updated the description of this plugin [on WP.org][IP-Geo-Block] as follows:

> The more you install themes and plugins, the more likely your sites will be 
> vulnerable, even if you [securely harden your sites][HardenSite].
>
> While WordPress.org [provides][WPSecurity] [excellent][Excellent] 
> [resources][Resources], themes and plugins may often get vulnerable due to 
> developers' [human factors][HumanFactors] such as lack of security awareness,
> misuse and disuse of the best practices in those resources.
>
> This plugin focuses on insights into such developers' human factors instead 
> of detecting the specific attack vectors after they were disclosed. This 
> brings a smart and powerful methods named as "**WP Zero-day Exploit 
> Prevention**" and "**WP Metadata Exploit Protection**".
>
> Combined with those methods and IP address geolocation, you'll be surprised
> to find a bunch of malicious or undesirable access blocked in the logs of
> this plugin after several days of installation.

I'm very proud of this plugin which has the only approach among security 
plugins ever released so far.

Have fun! <span class="emoji">
